# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
The process of creating simple software solutions to solve day to day challenges.
it makes it easy to run business
saves on time to get solutions

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
software engineering stsrted in 60s,  Fortrain ansD COBOL were aamomg the earliest programming languages, then C programming whixh was succeded by C++ and C# for system programming. Then Python, known for its simplicity and readability, quickly gained popularity among developers was introduced, python was used for development, artificial intelligence and data nalytics . with the growth in internet usage web development became crucial and web grommanging with HTML,CSS and Java script was introduced.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
problem definition - the initial need to have a software is realized from what is happening.
analysis- reserach is carried out to find out if the thr proposed system is needed and what the users need included in the system to make their work easier.
Design- the blurprint of the system is designed, which invluded data flow diagrams and entity realtionships diagrams to map out entities, attributes nd realtionships
Delopment- the actual coding is done to put to work what was designed
Implementation and testing- the complete software or module are out to work and testing perfomed to check if they are dvekopes as designed  per the user needs.
Maintennace- this is carried out to correct on what went wrong and upgrades  and updates.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

in waterfall methodology one phase has to completed so the next one can take place and testing is done once al the stsged are done while in Agile development it is carried in phases wgich make sis more easier to detect mistakes early and correct them.
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

software developer- puts  i nto code system designs to come up with a working sytem
Quality Assurance- makes sure that sytem developed meets all the set standards ,quality, user requirements as oulined during problem identification and analysis phase
Project manager- the overral lead who cordinates all the people and resources involved in the whole process.
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDE is a software platform that facilitates the creation of other software applications by providing a space to write, compile, and debug code example visual studio, Netbeans,AWS 
 VCs is software that tracks and manages changes to files and directories examples GIT, Azure DEVOPS Server

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
the rapid changes in technology, with so many open source development platforms and AI it is poisng agreat challenge 
can be ovecomed by  providing highly competitive softwares compared to those available in free versions.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit-focus on specific units or components of the software to determine whether each one is fully functiona
Integtarion testing- focus on checking if the speific units are intrgrating well with other units/models
System- the complete application is tested as a whole
Acceptance- determines whether the system is ready for release.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
the process of writing instructions to be followed by AI models, more siplified and accurare intructions will have ore clear and precise resuls

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
How do i answer intervie questions, instead write ' how can i answer question about my role as a propmpt engineer'
